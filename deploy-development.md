## PWA Progressive Web App

Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web

* [**Reliable**](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#reliable) - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
* [**Fast**](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#fast) - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
* [**Engaging**](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#engaging) - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.



## real-time applications

A real-time application \(RTA\) is an [application program](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/application) that functions within a time frame that the user senses as immediate or current. The [latency](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/latency) must be less than a defined value, usually measured in seconds. Whether or not a given application qualifies as an RTA depends on the worst-case execution time \(WCET\), the maximum length of time a defined task or set of tasks requires on a given [hardware](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/hardware) platform. The use of RTAs is called real-time computing \(RTC\).

* Videoconference applications
* [VoIP](https://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/definition/VoIP) \(voice over Internet Protocol\)
* Online [gaming](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/gaming)
* Community storage solutions
* Some e-commerce transactions
* Chatting
* IM \(instant messaging\)

## Working Flow

Github own branch

Use jest to test, and then push to my branch.

Other for CI/CD, use jenkins and pull my code, and build and deploy and test in Jenkins.

If there is problem, report to jira. And report this bug, then release new code and fix bug.

Github: version control.  Jenkins: CI/CD.  Jira: show the whole process and report bug.
