# DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.The term DevOps was formed by combining the words “development” and “operations”. As its name suggests, it seeks to bridge the gap between development and operation teams, which historically functioned in siloes. The concept of DevOps was founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in siloes.
