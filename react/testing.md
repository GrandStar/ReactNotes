# Testing

## Shallow Renderer



```text
import ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow'; // ES6
var ShallowRenderer = require('react-test-renderer/shallow'); 
```

When writing unit tests for React, shallow rendering can be helpful. Shallow rendering lets you render a component “one level deep” and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.

For example, if you have the following component:

```text
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <span className="heading">Title</span>
      <Subcomponent foo="bar" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then you can assert:

```text
import ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow';

// in your test:
const renderer = new ShallowRenderer();
renderer.render(<MyComponent />);
const result = renderer.getRenderOutput();

expect(result.type).toBe('div');
expect(result.props.children).toEqual([
  <span className="heading">Title</span>,
  <Subcomponent foo="bar" />
]);
```

Shallow testing currently has some limitations, namely not supporting refs.
